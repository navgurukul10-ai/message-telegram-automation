I’m looking for someone who can quickly build hands-on GenAI prototypes — small, working demos using the latest libraries, frameworks, and APIs. Your work will fuel my YouTube content and also be reused by my devs for client projects. This is not a research or documentation role — it’s about building fast, functional code.

Responsibilities
Build quick prototypes and demos using GenAI tools (LangChain, LangGraph, Transformers, OpenAI, Claude, etc.).
Explore new repos, frameworks, and APIs — turn them into minimal working examples.
Coordinate with my devs to convert project learnings into small reusable modules.
Keep code lightweight and demo-ready (Colab notebooks, FastAPI, Streamlit, etc.).
Track trends in GenAI and create working proofs-of-concept before they go mainstream.

Who You Are
Strong coding mindset — comfortable reading library code, debugging, and figuring things out with minimal docs.
Self-driven, fast learner, able to work independently.
More of a builder than a writer — you like prototypes over theory.
Bonus: experience with vector DBs, embeddings, RAG workflows, or open-source LLMs.

What You’ll Get
Hands-on exposure to cutting-edge GenAI frameworks.
Work directly with me and my dev team.
Your prototypes will directly turn into YouTube content and client-facing demos.
