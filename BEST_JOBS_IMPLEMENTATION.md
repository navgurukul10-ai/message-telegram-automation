# ‚úÖ Best Jobs Feature - Implementation Summary

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Job Quality Scoring System**
Created a sophisticated scoring algorithm (`src/services/job_scorer.py`) that evaluates each job posting based on:

| Feature | Points | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Company Name | 20 | Identifies company from message |
| Salary Info | 20 | Detects salary/CTC/package |
| Apply Link (URL) | 20 | Valid URL to apply (not email) |
| Location | 15 | Job location mentioned |
| Skills/Requirements | 15 | Technical or non-technical skills |
| Remote/WFH | 10 | Work from home option |

**Total:** 100 points maximum

### 2. **Best Jobs Criteria**
- Jobs with **score >= 60** qualify as "Best Jobs"
- Works for **both Tech and Non-Tech** jobs
- Sorted by score (highest first)

### 3. **Special Rule: International Jobs (STRICT)**
- For jobs **outside India**, Remote/WFH is **MANDATORY**
- If international job is NOT remote ‚Üí **Score = 0 (DISQUALIFIED)**
- International non-remote jobs will **NEVER** appear in Best Jobs
- Ensures only relevant remote international opportunities for Indian users

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
Updated `/api/best_jobs` endpoint to:
- Analyze last 200 messages
- Score each message
- Filter jobs with score >= 60
- Sort by quality score
- Return top 50 best jobs

### 5. **UI Updates**
- Changed "Best Verified Jobs" ‚Üí "Best Quality Jobs (Score 60+)"
- Display score as "‚≠ê Quality Score: 85/100"
- Works across all job types (Tech, Non-Tech, Freelance)
