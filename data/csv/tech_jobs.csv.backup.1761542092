Location : Pune ( NIBM ) 

Build for India. Ship to the world.

If you’re the kind of builder who trains at night, ships by morning, and lives to see real users light up—come write the next chapter with us. We’re pushing the edge of generative AI, from Small Language Models that run affordably at the edge to Large Language Models serving India-first and global use-cases across education, enterprise, and beyond.

What you’ll do

Train, fine-tune, and evaluate SLMs/LLMs (LoRA/QLoRA, PEFT, distillation, quantization).

Build robust data pipelines and evaluation harnesses; define metrics that actually reflect user value.

Ship production-grade inference (vLLM/ONNX/TensorRT/ggml) with strong latency & cost discipline.

Design RAG systems and agents for real workflows (vector DBs, retrieval, tool-use).

Own the lifecycle: experiments → ablations → PRs → deploy → monitor → iterate.

Read papers, prototype fast, and turn research into product.


What makes you a great fit

1–3 years hands-on ML experience (internships/projects count if they’re real and shipped).

Strong Python + PyTorch, solid grasp of transformers and modern training recipes.

Hugging Face ecosystem (datasets, tokenizers, PEFT, Accelerate); Git-first engineering.

Pragmatic about trade-offs: you profile, measure, and choose the simplest thing that works.

Owner’s mindset, low-ego collaborator, thrives in fast feedback loops.


Nice to have (bonus, not required):
JAX/Triton/CUDA kernels; Deepspeed/Megatron; quantization (AWQ/GPTQ); vector DBs (FAISS/Milvus); LangChain/LlamaIndex; MLOps (Weights & Biases/MLflow, Docker/K8s); Indic languages, speech/vision, on-device/edge inference.

Why join

Work on mission-scale problems that can transform access, affordability, and inclusion.

Ship end-to-end: your models will reach real users across India and global markets.

Learn fast with a team that pairs research rigor with product urgency.

Fair, transparent compensation aligned with our stage, plus high ownership, growth, and impact.


> If you’re optimizing primarily for learning, impact, and meaningful responsibility in a high-velocity team, you’ll feel at home here.

We’re hiring Senior / Staff-level Java Engineers who love building performant backend systems that run 24/7 and power millions in crypto and fiat transactions. You'll be joining the core backend team that underpins every Quidax product — from deposits and swaps to merchant payments and our API rails. It’s a high-trust, high-impact role for engineers who want to do the best work of their careers.

What We’re Looking For

You write clean code. You sweat the small stuff when it matters. You obsess over system design. And you care about impact.

8+ years in software engineering, primarily working  with Java 8+ & SpringBoot in production

Experience architecting and developing solutions to ambiguous problems with significant impact

Experience writing and maintaining highly scalable and performant code

Strong grasp of system design, microservices architecture, and distributed systems

Proficiency in relational databases (MySQL)

Rust Compiler Performance Triage (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/10/15/this-week-in-rust-621/#rust-compiler-performance-triage)
This week saw small wins across the board from some microoptimizations of the incremental query
system (#147423 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147423)). There have also been a couple of
regressions. #142390 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/142390) introduced regressions of check
builds across the board. The largest regression (18%) is from an incremental opt build of a secondary

Calls for Testing (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/10/15/this-week-in-rust-621/#calls-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.
If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
call-for-testing label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

No calls for testing were issued this week by
  Rust (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  Rust language RFCs (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  Cargo (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  Rustup (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).

Let us know (https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

About You
It's important to us that the person we hire will thrive in this role. Here are some core things we believe will set you up for success:

You have substantive professional experience with developing web services and understand the moving parts (DNS, HTTP, DBs, etc.). You have designed, built, and maintained projects and features that have been deployed to production.
You are familiar with Python, know both its strengths (and how to capitalize on them) and weak points (and how to work around them), and you’re able to argue about them. You follow the evolution of the Python ecosystem. You’ve also used at least one other programming language professionally, and you are open to crossing boundaries between stacks when the work demands it
You are familiar with OWASP Top 10 web app security risks and know how to avoid and mitigate them. You can assess the security implications of a pull request or an architectural decision.

📍 Client Location: Netherlands
📆 Project Duration: 3+ months
🕔 Involvement: Full-time
🎓Level - Senior

The project involves expanding automated test coverage for a suite of C++ GUI desktop applications. The primary focus is on building and maintaining a comprehensive set of functional and UI tests in Python, following a BDD approach (behave). The framework leverages SQLModel for data handling, Allure for reporting, and an in-house REST-based Windows UI automation server running on dedicated machines that mirror production environments.


**Responsibilities:**

• Design, implement, and maintain automated functional and GUI tests for C++ desktop applications.
• Develop effective test data strategies and select optimal testing approaches for complex workflows.
• Extend the current framework where necessary (new modules, utilities, integrations).
• Work with the in-house UI automation server (pyta-driver) through REST API to interact with Windows applications.
• Maintain transparent reporting (Allure), stability metrics, and regression visibility.
• Participate in code reviews and maintain high standards of code quality and documentation.
• Collaborate closely with developers, QA engineers, and client stakeholders, providing input on testing strategies and quality priorities.
• Ensure reproducible test execution on dedicated agents mirroring production

**Requirements:
**
• 5+ years of experience in test automation or development.
• Strong test design expertise: building coverage for complex business workflows, test data strategies, and risk-based testing.
• Hands-on experience writing and maintaining GUI/functional automated tests for desktop applications (Windows).
• Experience with BDD frameworks (behave) or readiness to quickly adopt them.
• Knowledge of databases and ORM in Python (preferably SQLModel) for test data setup and fixtures.
Familiarity with test reporting tools (e.g., Allure) - setting up clear, traceable reports and metrics.
• Confident use of Git, code review, and technical documentation practices.
• English level: Intermediate+ or higher (daily communication in the project).
• Strong problem-solving and collaboration skills.


**Nice to Have:**

• Understanding of C++ desktop architectures and Windows UI Automation
• Experience designing or extending custom automation frameworks.
CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (GitHub Actions/Jenkins), including parallel execution and artifacts.
• Knowledge of performance and stability testing for desktop applications.
• Experience working in medtech or regulated domains (quality, traceability, auditable reports).
• Experience using REST APIs to interact with and control applications or test automation tools. The primary task involves sending commands to an in-house UI automation server.

**Tech project stack: **

Python + behave (BDD)
SQLModel (ORM)
Allure Report (test reporting)
pyta-driver - in-house REST server for Windows UI Automation

Remote


We're looking for a results-driven API Sales Associate to be the engine of revenue growth for Quidax's API business. This isn't just a sales job; it's a chance to be at the forefront of our expansion, converting high-potential leads into high-volume partners.

You'll manage the entire sales cycle, from prospecting and outreach to demoing our solutions and closing deals. We need a doer, a B2B sales expert who is comfortable speaking with technical audiences and business leaders alike. You'll play a critical role in bringing our innovative API solutions to new markets and building a thriving ecosystem of high-volume merchants.


What We’re Looking For

You have 2 - 4 years of experience closing B2B sales deals in a fintech, SaaS, or API-first company, and you have the receipts to prove it.

You deeply understand the fintech ecosystem, especially in Africa. You know how APIs work, who needs them, and can translate complex technical features into clear business value for developers, CTOs, and business owners.

When most people were saying “Market down hai, jobs nahi mil rahi”, Sarthak chose to focus on skills instead of excuses — and that made all the difference.

🎯 As a complete fresher, he joined PyNet Labs’ 100% Job Guarantee Program, trusted the process, and today he’s successfully placed at Spectra, Gurugram as an NOC Executive, with an impressive 4 LPA package! 💼✨

His story reminds us that the job market isn’t shrinking — it’s evolving.
And companies may slow hiring, but they’ll always hire skilled talent — the kind PyNet Labs builds every day.

Our programs cover everything from CCNA to CCNP Enterprise, along with Network Automation, SD-WAN, Network Firewall, and Data Science/Data Analytics combinations — all backed by guaranteed placement support.

If you’re ready to turn your effort into results — just like Sarthak did — now’s the time to start your journey.

Remote

About You
It's important to us that the person we hire will thrive in this role. Here are some core things we believe will set you up for success:

You have substantive professional experience with developing web services and understand the moving parts (DNS, HTTP, DBs, etc.). You have designed, built, and maintained projects and features that have been deployed to production.
You are familiar with Python, know both its strengths (and how to capitalize on them) and weak points (and how to work around them), and you’re able to argue about them. You follow the evolution of the Python ecosystem. You’ve also used at least one other programming language professionally, and you are open to crossing boundaries between stacks when the work demands it
You are familiar with OWASP Top 10 web app security risks and know how to avoid and mitigate them. You can assess the security implications of a pull request or an architectural decision.
You are familiar with MySQL or PostgreSQL and have experience with their core concepts and subtleties. You care about and understand the performance impact of SQL queries you (or your code) writes, and have experience assessing and optimizing their performance.
You feel at home in the Unix shell. You are familiar with grep, and sed or awk. You often write bash or Python scripts to automate your work.
You’ve written tests long enough to have a taste for what a good test looks like, are aware of current testing practices, and can argue about each approach’s merits.

As a senior full stack engineer, you'll...

Ship end-to-end features -- design, code, test, deploy, and own them in production.

Work directly with users to turn feedback into improvements within hours, not days.

Build and operate both frontend and backend code that stays fast and reliable as traffic grows.

Support the team by reviewing PRs, sharing context, and mentoring junior engineers.

You'll be successful in this role if you…

- Are a relentlessly resourceful engineer with experience building real-world applications, with a high bar for quality.

- If you've personally built something people use, years of experience is basically irrelevant.

- Can go from 0 to 1 building full stack applications.

- Love tackling extremely difficult problems.

- Enjoy learning and working in a very fast-paced environment.

- Work well on a small team.

Calls for Testing (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/10/08/this-week-in-rust-620/#calls-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.
If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
call-for-testing label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

No calls for testing were issued this week by

Looking for:

Senior FullStack Engineer (Svelte, Golang, Claude Code) or 1 Senior Frontend / 1 Backend

(Please, send @ElenaRedzel candidates only with the relevant skills specified in the white label CVs!)

Нам потрібні: один Senior FullStack Engineer (Svelte, Golang, Claude Code) або 2 розробники Senior Front-end Developer (Svelte, Claude Code) та Senior Backend Developer (Golang, Claude Code).
Цікавлять розробники з досвідом - 5+ years of experience.
Обов'язкова вимога - Proven experience using Claude Code or similar agentic AI (Cursor, Windsurf). Клієнт каже, що якщо не було досвіду з Claude Code, то таких взагалі розглядати не будуть.
Англійська - обов'язково хороша англійська, мінімум Upper-Intermediate. Прохання з нижчим рівнем англійської не пропонувати кандидатів.
Зайнятість: full-time, long-term.

Стар: asap
Локація: будь-яка
Рейти: Front-end - до $30, Back-end - до $35, FullStack - до $36.

Опис вакансії наданий нижче.
Клієнт з Німеччини. VC-funded AI tourism platform. Клієнт зазначає наступне: This is not a traditional coding role - you'll use Claude Code and other AI tools to 10x your output, always thinking about how the product or feature you are working on benefits the user. Also, we have no QA team - you OWN the quality of what you ship. Products you will build: API: platform features, tooling, multi-agent system, etc. UIs: internal UIs, B2B dashboards, B2C web apps.

Опис вакансії:
We are seeking a Senior Svelte Front-end Developer with experience in Golang (so that they are full-stack). It is essential that the person is highly product-driven, self-motivated, speaks excellent English, and enjoys using coding AI tools like Claude Code.
Our stack:
● Frontend: SvelteKit, turbo monorepo, Vercel
● Backend: Golang monorepo
● AI: Claude Code (mandatory), other agentic coding tools
What you’ll actually do:
● Own features end-to-end: from specs to deployment to fixing bugs
● Use Claude Code to generate SvelteKit frontend and Golang backend code
● Review AI output for quality and architectural fit
● Fix bugs to learn our codebase, then rapidly build new features
● Make quick decisions on what to build vs buy vs generate with AI
● Talk to customers when they report issues and ship fixes the same day
You must have:
● Ownership mentality with a strive for elegantly simple, high-quality solutions
● Strive for max quality — you test your own work thoroughly since we have no QA team, everything you ship MUST work
● Product mindset — you care about WHY we’re building something
● Proven experience using Claude Code or similar agentic AI (Cursor, Windsurf)
● Strong SvelteKit and Golang experience — you’ll review AI’s code in these, and you must understand how it works
● Broad architectural knowledge of building modern full-stack applications
● Excellent spoken English and a good internet connection for daily video calls

You are a great fit if you:
● Get frustrated when development takes weeks instead of days
● You think in features and architecture, and not single lines of code
● Can spot subtle bugs in AI-generated code quickly
● You ship fast, but always verify it actually works
● Have shipped real products that customers actually use
● Think “how can AI build this?” as your first instinct

!! Red flags (don’t apply if):
● You’ve never used Claude Code or similar AI coding tools
● Your English is intermediate
● You need detailed specs before starting
● You see AI as a threat rather than leverage

Looking for:

Senior FullStack Engineer (Svelte, Golang, Claude Code) or 1 Senior Frontend / 1 Backend

(Please, send @ElenaRedzel candidates only with the relevant skills specified in the white label CVs!)

Нам потрібні: один Senior FullStack Engineer (Svelte, Golang, Claude Code) або 2 розробники Senior Front-end Developer (Svelte, Claude Code) та Senior Backend Developer (Golang, Claude Code).
Цікавлять розробники з досвідом - 5+ years of experience.
Обов'язкова вимога - Proven experience using Claude Code or similar agentic AI (Cursor, Windsurf). Клієнт каже, що якщо не було досвіду з Claude Code, то таких взагалі розглядати не будуть.
Англійська - обов'язково хороша англійська, мінімум Upper-Intermediate. Прохання з нижчим рівнем англійської не пропонувати кандидатів.
Зайнятість: full-time, long-term.

Стар: asap
Локація: будь-яка
Рейти: Front-end - до $30, Back-end - до $35, FullStack - до $36.

Опис вакансії наданий нижче.
Клієнт з Німеччини. VC-funded AI tourism platform. Клієнт зазначає наступне: This is not a traditional coding role - you'll use Claude Code and other AI tools to 10x your output, always thinking about how the product or feature you are working on benefits the user. Also, we have no QA team - you OWN the quality of what you ship. Products you will build: API: platform features, tooling, multi-agent system, etc. UIs: internal UIs, B2B dashboards, B2C web apps.

Опис вакансії:
We are seeking a Senior Svelte Front-end Developer with experience in Golang (so that they are full-stack). It is essential that the person is highly product-driven, self-motivated, speaks excellent English, and enjoys using coding AI tools like Claude Code.
Our stack:
● Frontend: SvelteKit, turbo monorepo, Vercel
● Backend: Golang monorepo
● AI: Claude Code (mandatory), other agentic coding tools
What you’ll actually do:
● Own features end-to-end: from specs to deployment to fixing bugs
● Use Claude Code to generate SvelteKit frontend and Golang backend code
● Review AI output for quality and architectural fit
● Fix bugs to learn our codebase, then rapidly build new features
● Make quick decisions on what to build vs buy vs generate with AI
● Talk to customers when they report issues and ship fixes the same day
You must have:
● Ownership mentality with a strive for elegantly simple, high-quality solutions
● Strive for max quality — you test your own work thoroughly since we have no QA team, everything you ship MUST work
● Product mindset — you care about WHY we’re building something
● Proven experience using Claude Code or similar agentic AI (Cursor, Windsurf)
● Strong SvelteKit and Golang experience — you’ll review AI’s code in these, and you must understand how it works
● Broad architectural knowledge of building modern full-stack applications
● Excellent spoken English and a good internet connection for daily video calls

You are a great fit if you:
● Get frustrated when development takes weeks instead of days
● You think in features and architecture, and not single lines of code
● Can spot subtle bugs in AI-generated code quickly
● You ship fast, but always verify it actually works
● Have shipped real products that customers actually use
● Think “how can AI build this?” as your first instinct

!!️ Red flags (don’t apply if):
● You’ve never used Claude Code or similar AI coding tools
● Your English is intermediate
● You need detailed specs before starting
● You see AI as a threat rather than leverage

more packing #147002 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147002) and
simplifications to doc(cfg) in Implement RFC 3631: add rustdoc doc_cfg features
#138907 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/138907).

Rust Compiler Performance Triage (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/09/24/this-week-in-rust-618/#rust-compiler-performance-triage)
Moving command-line argument quoting from C++ to Rust (#146700 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146700)) resulted in a nice performance
win when dealing with many dependencies and large workspaces. A somewhat costly destination propagation
compiler pass was enabled by default (#142915 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/142915)), which resulted in some build time regressions,
but should result in improved runtime performance. The rest of changes were small.
Triage done by @kobzol.
Revision range: 52618eb3..ce4beebe (https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=52618eb338609df44978b0ca4451ab7941fd1c7a&end=ce4beebecb77821734079cff47d8af08f9f27f11&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

Crate of the Week (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/09/24/this-week-in-rust-618/#crate-of-the-week)
This week's crate is faer (https://docs.rs/faer), a eneral-purpose linear algebra library for rust, with a focus on high performance for algebraic operations on medium/large matrices, as well as matrix decompositions.
Despite another week going by without a suggested weekly crate, llogiq is pleased with his choice.
Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week (https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704)!
Calls for Testing (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/09/24/this-week-in-rust-618/#calls-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.
If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
call-for-testing label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

No calls for testing were issued this week by
  Rust (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  Rust language RFCs (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  Cargo (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  Rustup (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).

Let us know (https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

Crate of the Week (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/09/17/this-week-in-rust-617/#crate-of-the-week)
This week's crate is asciinema (https://crates.io/crates/asciinema), a well-known command-line tool for recording, replaying and streaming terminal sessions recently rewritten in Rust.
Despite a lack of suggestions, llogiq is plenty happy with his choice.
Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week (https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704)!
Calls for Testing (https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/09/17/this-week-in-rust-617/#calls-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.
If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
call-for-testing label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

No calls for testing were issued this week by
  Rust (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  Rust language RFCs (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  Cargo (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  Rustup (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).

Let us know (https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

🔍 Problem of the Day: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

🧠 Description:
 Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
 Do not allocate extra space for another array — modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

📥 Example:
 Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5]
 Output: 5 (The first 5 elements of nums should be [1,2,3,4,5])

💡 Approach:
 • Use two pointers:
i points to the position of the last unique element.
j scans the array.
 • When nums[j] != nums[i], increment i and update nums[i] = nums[j].
 • Return i + 1 as the new length

✅ Java Solution:
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
 if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
 int i = 0;
 for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
 if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
 i++;
 nums[i] = nums[j];
 }
 }
 return i + 1;

They’re [Scotty](https://scottytechnologies.com/), an AI operating platform with offices in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and Portugal 🇵🇹. They design, build, deploy, test, and manage AI workers to automate HR, Ops, Support, and more. No tedious manually‑repeating stuff, just multi‑agent systems that plug into what you already use and bring big efficiency. 

They are now looking for 3 extraordinary people to work remotely:

👉 **Principal Front‑End Engineer** (€70‑90k)

Rebuild their user interaction layer from scratch. Real ownership. Real impact. WebRTC/WebSocket skills are a huge plus.

[Learn more/apply](https://scottytechnologies.bamboohr.com/careers/74?source=aWQ9NA%3D%3D)

👉 **Forward Deployed Engineer** (€80‑110k)

Prototype, demo & deploy AI solutions that actually work. Think MacGyvering with AI agents and APIs. Directly work with key clients.

[Learn more/apply](https://scottytechnologies.bamboohr.com/careers/73?source=aWQ9NA%3D%3D)

👉 **Delivery Director** (€70‑90k)

Bring predictability and professionalism to their enterprise rollouts. Bonus if you’ve wrangled Jira like a rodeo star.

[Learn more/apply](https://scottytechnologies.bamboohr.com/careers/72?source=aWQ9NA%3D%3D)

**What makes them special:
**
📌 They allow you to build and manage AI workers (pre‑built or custom) for teams in HR, Customer Service, Marketing, Sales, Healthcare, etc. 

📌 Their multi‑agent systems collaborate across any framework or channel. They support integrations and deployment on the cloud or on‑premises. 

📌 Key values: no vendor/LLM lock‑in, white‑label options, enterprise readiness, high scale (hundreds of thousands of conversations, +100 languages). 

📌 Remote‑friendly, performance & attitude matter more than where you sit. Top performers get equity. They also shut down company‑wide twice a year to rest.

But beyond the fun, this anniversary was about appreciating the journey we’ve all been part of. From a small team of just 5–6 people in our 1st anniversary to now a family of 30+ (and still growing) every milestone has been possible because of our people, clients, and partners.

**2️⃣ Можно ли сейчас быть востребованным специалистом без активного использования AI **

— Кейсы Klarna (заменили 80% саппорта на AI, а потом снова стали нанимать) и Shopify (нельзя нанять человека, пока не докажешь, что задачу не решить через AI) 
— Какие изменения уже произошли и что будет в ближайшие полгода

3️⃣ **Как внедрять AI, если ты думаешь, что это невозможно**

— AI-first mindset: как начать думать задачами, а не инструментами 
— Живые примеры, как Макс сам использует AI в ежедневной работе

В крупном финтех-стартапе разработчику говорят прямо на собеседовании: 
__Не пользуетесь AI-инструментами? Извините, но мы выбираем другого кандидата__

Klarna уволили 80% саппорта, заменив их на AI. В Shopify теперь нельзя нанять человека, пока не докажешь, что задачу невозможно решить через AI. А в резюме без упоминания AI-навыков **рекрутеры уже видят красный флаг.
**
AI трансформирует рынок труда прямо сейчас. Есть ощущение, что если ты не начнешь использовать AI в ближайшее время — **ты** **рискуешь перестать быть востребованным специалистом.**

__Что это значит лично для тебя?__

📆 4 сентября в 19:00 по МСК **Макс Постников** разберёт эту тему с нескольких важных ракурсов на вебинаре **«Как AI меняет рынок труда и влияет на твой поиск работы?»

Last week, we took time to analyze those relocation-friendly openings – here’s what we found:


📌 **Germany** leads the way in relocation-friendly job postings for software engineers.

📌 **FinTech** is the hottest industry – even hotter than AI.

📌 **Scale-ups and midsize companies** are posting more jobs than MAANG.


Out of the 1,500+ job postings, **Back-End** roles topped the charts with 500+ openings – more than double the next category. Even in a world dominated by AI hype, the need for solid back-end engineering remains undisputed. 

That’s great news for experienced engineers whose skills may not be flashy but are absolutely essential.

At the same time, **Data & AI** roles are holding strong with 350+ openings. Within that group, job titles like Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer make up the bulk of listings.

It’s also notable that **DevOps & Infrastructure** roles rank third. This shows that global companies continue to invest in stability and scaling.

Hands-on coding is still key.

In a recent episode of __The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck__, Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, shared his take on the future of coding in the age of AI. 

**1. Flow state is everything.**
Developers want to stay deep in code. Copilot helps, but the real magic still comes from writing it yourself.

**2. Agents won’t replace your brain.**
Even when AI writes code and submits a PR, devs take it local, tweak, and edit. It’s faster to fix it yourself than prompt for every change.

**3. Docs & tests? Automated, yes, but…**
Copilot Agent can generate them, but human review is still essential to make them usable and project-ready.

**4. AI isn’t perfect.**
Even the best models today only get 60–70% of Python tasks right—and less in other languages. Human oversight is non-negotiable.

**5. Like cloud or Docker, AI shifts how we work, not what we do.**
Manual coding remains critical for quality, creativity, and solving novel problems.

**6. AI is here to help, not replace.**
The keyboard’s still in your hands.

After my Playtika project ended,I kicked off my search by letting my friends know I was seeking new opportunities. 
Eventually, my CV reached Aner Luz, an independent headhunter specializing in Adtech and Martech.

His service is completely free - he gets paid by companies when they hire his candidates, so he actively advocates for you to HR departments.

My personal experience? 
Aner helped me secure interviews at 2 companies. Although I made it to the final stage, I wasn't selected. My varied background didn't perfectly match the specialized requirements these companies wanted.

Despite this, I believe such passive job hunting is a great way to explore opportunities.

If you're interested, consider adding your CV to Aner's pool. 
He specializes in the following roles:
* Development - R&D/full stack

* Social - ppc user acquisition - Affiliate

* Customer Success / account management / technical CS (support)

Andrew here, founder of Relocate.me.

As you might remember, my team and I previously announced the launch of __The Global Move__ (relocateme.substack.com).

I have an important update:

After much consideration, **I’ve decided to shift its focus toward those looking to relocate abroad for work in tech**. That said, I’ll still share notable visa news and helpful resources, but only occasionally.

I’ve introduced two tiers - free and paid.

The main content I’ll be posting regularly will be **handpicked lists of tech jobs with relocation** - about 100 jobs per week. 

These hand-curated selections will be available **exclusively to my paid subscribers**!

For now, the price is just **$10 per month**.

I think it’s a good investment because it will save you hours of job searching. 

Plus, you’ll get access to exclusive content and Q&A sessions with me and recruiters hiring internationally.

The first batch of handpicked, relocation-friendly tech jobs was published yesterday:

• Back End - 30 roles
• Front End - 7 roles
• Full Stack - 7 roles
• Mobile - 9 roles
• DevOps - 9 roles
• Data & AI - 16 roles
• QA & Test Engineering - 5 roles
• Engineering Management - 11 roles
• Other - 10 roles

For those interested, here’s the link to the publication: 

👉 https://relocateme.substack.com/p/hand-curated-tech-jobs-with-relocation

Those who subscribe as paid members will automatically get a spot in my upcoming webinar with live resume reviews. But hurry - it’s scheduled for **March 12th**!","qa,ai,devops,full stack",Account 3,tech

The story is dated July 2023, but it still offers some solid advice. For example:


__""I recommend saving the jobs you think you’re a good fit for and then allocating time once in a few days to write your resume based on the matching criteria between your skillset and the JD.""__


__""If you have an ex-colleague who you worked with and you vibed together, just think about that person. Try to explain in your cover letter or in your first interactions with the hiring team that you can give refer a person to talk to about you in a previous workplace. Some companies want to have that talk.""__


__""Be confident.

Going through the process, I realized that the skills listed in job postings are often idealized. They describe the perfect candidate who probably doesn’t even exist.

I applied to jobs where I met at least 70% of the required skills...""__
