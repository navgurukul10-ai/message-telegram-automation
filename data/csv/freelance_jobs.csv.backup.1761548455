Location : Pune ( NIBM ) 

Build for India. Ship to the world.

If you’re the kind of builder who trains at night, ships by morning, and lives to see real users light up—come write the next chapter with us. We’re pushing the edge of generative AI, from Small Language Models that run affordably at the edge to Large Language Models serving India-first and global use-cases across education, enterprise, and beyond.

What you’ll do

Train, fine-tune, and evaluate SLMs/LLMs (LoRA/QLoRA, PEFT, distillation, quantization).

Build robust data pipelines and evaluation harnesses; define metrics that actually reflect user value.

Ship production-grade inference (vLLM/ONNX/TensorRT/ggml) with strong latency & cost discipline.

Design RAG systems and agents for real workflows (vector DBs, retrieval, tool-use).

Own the lifecycle: experiments → ablations → PRs → deploy → monitor → iterate.

Read papers, prototype fast, and turn research into product.


What makes you a great fit

1–3 years hands-on ML experience (internships/projects count if they’re real and shipped).

Strong Python + PyTorch, solid grasp of transformers and modern training recipes.

Hugging Face ecosystem (datasets, tokenizers, PEFT, Accelerate); Git-first engineering.

Pragmatic about trade-offs: you profile, measure, and choose the simplest thing that works.

Owner’s mindset, low-ego collaborator, thrives in fast feedback loops.


Nice to have (bonus, not required):
JAX/Triton/CUDA kernels; Deepspeed/Megatron; quantization (AWQ/GPTQ); vector DBs (FAISS/Milvus); LangChain/LlamaIndex; MLOps (Weights & Biases/MLflow, Docker/K8s); Indic languages, speech/vision, on-device/edge inference.

Why join

Work on mission-scale problems that can transform access, affordability, and inclusion.

Ship end-to-end: your models will reach real users across India and global markets.

Learn fast with a team that pairs research rigor with product urgency.

Fair, transparent compensation aligned with our stage, plus high ownership, growth, and impact.


> If you’re optimizing primarily for learning, impact, and meaningful responsibility in a high-velocity team, you’ll feel at home here.

After my Playtika project ended,I kicked off my search by letting my friends know I was seeking new opportunities. 
Eventually, my CV reached Aner Luz, an independent headhunter specializing in Adtech and Martech.

His service is completely free - he gets paid by companies when they hire his candidates, so he actively advocates for you to HR departments.

My personal experience? 
Aner helped me secure interviews at 2 companies. Although I made it to the final stage, I wasn't selected. My varied background didn't perfectly match the specialized requirements these companies wanted.

Despite this, I believe such passive job hunting is a great way to explore opportunities.

If you're interested, consider adding your CV to Aner's pool. 
He specializes in the following roles:
* Development - R&D/full stack
* DevOps
* Social - ppc user acquisition - Affiliate 
* Sales
* Customer Success / account management / technical CS (support)
* Analyst - for marketing - Gaming
* marketing - email/content
* product manager - in AdTech/Gaming/product
* Design 
* Accounting - for ERP systems 
* website manager
