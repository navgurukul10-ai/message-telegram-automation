1137929410_87713,Rust Programming Language,https://t.me/rust_community,715980729,2025-10-16T19:26:55+00:00,"docs.rs: changed default targets
https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/10/16/docsrs-changed-default-targets/


Changes to default build targets on docs.rs
This post announces two changes to the list of default targets used to build
documentation on docs.rs.
Crate authors can specify a custom list of targets using
docs.rs metadata in Cargo.toml. If this
metadata is not provided, docs.rs falls back to a default list. We are updating
this list to better reflect the current state of the Rust ecosystem.

Apple silicon (ARM64) replaces x86_64
Reflecting Apple's transition from x86_64 to its own ARM64 silicon, the Rust
project has updated its platform support tiers. The aarch64-apple-darwin
target is now Tier 1, while x86_64-apple-darwin has moved to Tier 2. You can
read more about this in RFC 3671 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3671)
and RFC 3841 (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3841).
To align with this, docs.rs will now use aarch64-apple-darwin as the default
target for Apple platforms instead of x86_64-apple-darwin.

Linux ARM64 replaces 32-bit x86
Support for 32-bit i686 architectures is declining, and major Linux
distributions have begun to phase it out.
Consequently, we are replacing the i686-unknown-linux-gnu target with
aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu in our default set.

New default target list
The updated list of default targets is:

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
aarch64-apple-darwin (replaces x86_64-apple-darwin)
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (replaces i686-unknown-linux-gnu)
i686-pc-windows-msvc


Opting out
If your crate requires the previous default target list, you can explicitly
define it in your Cargo.toml:
[package.metadata.docs.rs]
targets = [
    ""x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"",
    ""x86_64-apple-darwin"",
    ""x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"",
    ""i686-unknown-linux-gnu"",
    ""i686-pc-windows-msvc""
]

Note that docs.rs continues to support any target available in the Rust
toolchain; only the default list has changed.",support,Account 4,non_tech

Ты аналитик? Работаешь с данными? Мы запускаем очередное исследование рынка твоей профессии и хотим узнать твоё мнение!

**Мы в NEWHR исследуем рынок аналитиков с 2018 года!**

Выясняем, как меняется профессия, чего хочет бизнес от аналитиков, чего хотят сами аналитики, сколько стоят аналитики и какими технологиями пользуются. 

 __Вот несколько инсайтов из __[__исследования 2024 года__](https://newhr.org/data/research-analysts-2024)__: __

**➖**** Зарплаты в 2024 году продолжали расти (и не зря — значимость хорошей зарплаты резко выросла по сравнению с 2023 годом)**

Больше половины респондентов признались нам, что деньги для них — на первом месте. В 2023 году так считали всего 25%.  

**➖**** Аналитики стали реже менять работодателей**

При этом снижение активности по смене работы не повлияло на интерес к собеседованиям — мониторить рынок остаётся стабильной потребностью.
**
****➖**** Зарубежные компании уже не так привлекательны для аналитиков из России**

Это слом тренда 2022−2023 годов. Наши респонденты стали больше ориентироваться на рынок, который ближе к ним: в России — на российский, за рубежом — на зарубежный. 

**➖**** ****🤍**** Авито — самая привлекательная компания-работодатель для аналитиков **

На втором месте — ❤️ Яндекс, на третьем —  ✈️ Авиасейлс.

**Что поменялось за год? Помоги нам узнать, поучаствовав в новом исследовании! 
**
Опрос займёт около 20 минут. Участники получат ранний доступ к результатам и приглашение на закрытый эфир с инсайтами исследования.

**🔤**[**Пройти опрос**](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8488868/analytics-NEWHR-2025)**🔤**

__Если ты хочешь «копнуть глубже» — вот результаты наших прошлых исследований: __[2019,](https://vc.ru/hr/82631-issledovanie-rynka-analitikov) [2020,](https://vc.ru/hr/136050-analitika-dlya-hantinga-analitikov-produktovyh-marketingovyh-i-data-scientists) [2022,](https://vc.ru/hr/502886-produktovye-analitiki-bolshoe-issledovanie-zarplat-i-tendenciy-na-rynke) [2023,](https://newhr.org/data/research-analysts-2023) [2024.](https://newhr.org/data/research-analysts-2024)

*️⃣ В первых исследованиях мы больше фокусировались на продуктовых и дата-аналитиках, но теперь, по многочисленным просьбам, мы **адаптировали вопросы также для руководителей аналитики, системных и бизнес-аналитиков**.

P. S. Пожалуйста, поделись [ссылкой на опрос](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8488868/analytics-NEWHR-2025) с коллегами-аналитиками! Чем больше участников, тем точнее и интереснее результаты 💙",hr,Account 2,non_tech

Scrolling through LinkedIn yesterday, I spotted multiple fake LinkedIn profiles & job posts (see image) that looked almost perfect—big brand, multiple locations, impressive salary, remote options. But look closer:

❌ The recruiter asks for resumes via a generic email (not an official company domain)

❌  No verifiable details on the employer

❌ Wide salary range and vague descriptions

❌ Rapid closing dates without company page links

Fake postings like this are everywhere now. They target talented professionals and fresh graduates, often stealing time, data, or even money with false promises.

🤔 Have you seen similar posts?
🤔 How did you spot the scam?

Share your story or tips below—let’s protect each other!

✅ Verify recruiter profiles and email domains

✅ Ask for official company channels before sharing data

✅ Report suspicious posts to LinkedIn
